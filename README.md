# CloneDetectionProject
Copying code fragment and reusing them through paste option with or without minor modification or adaption is called Code Cloning and pasted code fragment is called clone. Code Clones are the duplicated code which degrade software quality and hence increase maintenance cost. The proposed hybrid approach uses texual analysis and template conversion for detection of method level  synactic clones in C files and semantic clones in C and Java files. .
